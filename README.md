ZipClips - Group Moviemaking

ZipClips allows people to easily share video of group events in a meaningful and customizable way.  There exists many
situations where groups of people shoot clips of video at an event but where no one person captures the full "story".
As a group, however, the information is there.  The trick is to present it in a meaningful way that is easy to
use.
